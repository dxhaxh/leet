This repo contains one jupyter notebook file that contains a bunch of leetcode solutions. Every cell contains a leetcode problem. There are comments with the problem's title that  leetcode, most of the cells have a description of the problem in comments. A lot of cells also have comments explaining the solution and the data structures/algorithms used in the solution, these comments also explain the time complexities and space complexities. One thing to note is that most of the cells are missing the function signatures, it is clear what variables are inputs to the function.
